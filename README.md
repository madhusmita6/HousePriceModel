## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market
-  The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the Australian market
- It required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not

## Conclusions
- Top 5 predictor variables are as per Ridge Regression Model are
- GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
- Neighborhood_NoRidge : Northridge
- 1stFlrSF: First Floor square feet
- GarageCars: Size of garage in car capacity
- FullBath: Full bathrooms above grade
- Top 5 predictor variables are as per Lasso Regression Model are
- GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
- Neighborhood_NoRidge : Northridge
- LotArea: Lot size in square feet
- GarageCars: Size of garage in car capacity
- Neighbourhood_NridgHt	Northridge Heights
